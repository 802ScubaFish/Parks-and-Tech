This web application was created for VRPA by the Parks and Tech team of Burlington Code Academy. 

Some styling was inspired by https://github.com/codeSTACKr/hamburger-animation/blob/master/style.css.

The Goal of this application is to create a place that all departments can access, and add events + facilities to. Before this sites creation there was no single location for all of this information to be stored. 

There are two main "sections" to this application. The main "home" page that users will interact with. As well as an Admin dashboard where new events and facilities can be easily added to the existing Google Firebase Database. 

The Events and Facilities are each put through vairous conversions to display the desired data in the desired formats. 
/ Some of these can be chosen by the users themsleves and can be used to further filter the displayed data depedning on the desired information the user is seaching for.

The site's color pallete is selected straight from the current VRPA site to keep things consistant and smooth for users navigating between each location.

The mission statement and links (donations, phone call, email, site url, etc . .) are all connected to the correct paths to link to the existing VRPA locations. 

This application was built and styled by Christian Dow, Jayson Durante, Jenna Durell, and Emily Reynolds as a proof of concept as a capstone project for Burlington Code Acdmy.
